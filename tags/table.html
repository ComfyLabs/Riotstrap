<!-- 
  Table component.
  Bunch of TODOs, but mostly "works".

  These docs are cool. I probably need a docparser now.

  <!--
    Add documentation of public component

  <div class="col-md-7">
    <!--
      TODO:
        1. This col/offset specification should be a project specific mixin
        2. ....and **definitely** not hard coded ;)

        The same needs to be done with the css properties of the table class
        below, it'll work for now because we're defaulting to true, but this
        is far from reusable.

    <table class="table {table-bordered: opts.bordered || true, table-striped: opts.striped || true}">

<!-- internal components -->

<rs-thead>
  <!--
    This component must be passed as an attribute to <thead>
    for styles to correctly apply.

    This is an internal tag though so shouldn't really have
    to use it outside <rs-table>

    TODO:
      Decide on how to namespace internal tags?

    Example usage:
      <thead riot-tag="rs-table-head" headers={opts.headers}></thead>
  -->
  <tr>
    <th each="{header in opts.headers}">{header}</th>
  </tr>
</rs-thead>

<rs-tbody>
  <!--
    This component must be passed as an attribute to <tbody>
    for styles to correctly apply.

    This is an internal tag though so shouldn't really have
    to use it outside <rs-table>
  -->
  <tr each="{row in opts.rows}">
    <td each="{item in row}">{item}</td>
  </tr>
</rs-tbody>
